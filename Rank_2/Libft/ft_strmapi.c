/**
 * @brief Applies a given function to each character of a string, creating a new
 * transformed string.
 *
 * This function iterates through each character of the string 's' and applies
 * the function 'f' to each character along with its corresponding index. The
 * result of applying the function to each character is used to construct a new
 * string, which is dynamically allocated. The new string is null-terminated,
 * and a pointer to it is returned.
 *
 * @param s The string to iterate over.
 * @param f The function to apply to each character along with its index.
 * @return A pointer to the newly allocated transformed string, or NULL if
 * memory allocation fails.
